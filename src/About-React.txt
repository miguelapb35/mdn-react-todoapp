REACT BASICS

In React;

1. Components can import modules they need and must 
export themselves at the bottom of ther files

2. Component functions are named with PascalCase.

3. You can read JSX variables by putting them between 
curly braces, like {so}.

4. Some JSX attributes are different than HTML attributes 
so that they dont't conflict with JavaScript 
reserved words. For example, class in HTML translates 
to className in JSX. Note that multi-word attributes 
are camel-cased.

5. Props are written just like attributes inside 
component calls and are passed into components.
